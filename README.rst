=================================

DISCLAIMER
----------
This module is under development and is considered a beta-release (not suitable for production use yet). 
The API will most likelly change during this development process with the help of any feedback received from
potential beta testers.


Description
-----------

A Python suite for working with river models. 

Goals

Offer an abstraction layer for the definition of river models and tools to operate on this models
or when possible calling the model engine (controller). So far the library offers:

* **HEC-RAS**: Wrapper for the COM interface of the HEC-RAS controller. (windows only)

For the upcoming developments this library will define a pythonic interface to different objects
found in the HEC-RAS river model (sections, structures, nodes etc).


Requirements
------------

This package depends on pywin32 for accessing the HECRASController interface.

Additionally, you need to have a working version of HEC-RAS installed. 
Current support includes version 4.1.0 and 5.0.0.


Installation
------------

**The easy way:**

1. Install the anaconda distribution (comes with PyWin32 preinstalled)

2. On the command line type:
